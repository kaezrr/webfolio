## Introduction

Hi, I’m **Kaezr** ([kaezrr](https://github.com/kaezrr) on GitHub). I've been exploring various tech fields for a while now, and I finally decided to create my own personal website. This site will be my primary space to share ideas and showcase my work. I’ve always disliked platforms like LinkedIn, but I still have a profile there because it’s considered an *"industry standard"*.

The thoughts I share here are mine and not AI-generated, because I want this website to reflect *who I am*, not what I want others to *think* I am. I’ll try to write regularly, but I’m not the type of person to follow strict schedules. So, forgive me if I take breaks when inspiration doesn’t strike.

## Why Bother with All This?

Writing is an important skill, and though I’m usually reserved with my opinions, this is one area I feel strongly about. Unfortunately, I haven't written much since joining college, and I aim to change that. Humans are among the few species who can use tools, and we’re the only ones who *encode* our thoughts onto external objects, allowing those thoughts to persist beyond our lifetimes.

I hope this website serves as a sort of time capsule, preserving my thoughts long after I’m gone. Sure, this is just another blog in a sea of many, but it’s not only for others, it’s also for me, and for my future self.

## About This Website

You’ll notice this website is simple, minimal, and doesn’t feature a lot of the flashy animations you typically see in portfolio sites. That’s because I wanted it to be a true representation of who I am, minimal and functional. I don’t like bloat, and my workflows and environments are often pared down to the essentials. That said, aesthetics matter too, as we often *see* before we *read*. I think this website looks good *despite* being minimal.

As plagiarism is bad (I’m sure [hbomberguy](https://youtu.be/yDp3cB5fHXQ?si=ylsRkmRivSJdJ32L) would agree), I’d like to give credit where it’s due:

- **Astro Web Framework**
- **astro-erudite Template**
- **JetBrains Mono Font** (my beloved)
- The logo is **Napstablook** from *Undertale* :)

Everything I program and create (including this site) is open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/kaezrr) and I hope to continue that trend as much as reasonably possible.
